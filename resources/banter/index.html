              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <h3>Banter is…</h3>
              <p>an Olin alumni-run program designed to connect current students and alumni to share experience. Newly expanded to connect alumni with alumni !</p>
              <h4>Banter</h4>
              <p>noun.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>a chance to build a lasting relationship with a member of the Olin alumni community, while receiving advice such as:
                <ul>
                  <li>how to use your time at Olin to best prepare for your career,</li>
                  <li>how to stockpile projects for your portfolio,</li>
                  <li>what start-up life is really like,</li>
                  <li>what grad programs look for,</li>
                  <li>and much more!</li>
                </ul></li>
                <li>a low time-commitment, high awesomeness program that lets you talk with an Olin alumnus of your choosing for an hour per month, remotely or in person.</li>
                <li>a way to expand your network in Boston and beyond (way beyond!), and finally find out:
                  <ul>
                    <li>who set off the first-ever burnt-popcorn fire alarm,</li>
                    <li>what mod life was all about,</li>
                    <li>how good Mark Somerville’s legs look in fishnets,</li>
                    <li>who first put up the rope swing in Parcel B,</li>
                    <li>and much more!</li>
                  </ul></li>
                  <li>It works like this:
                  <ul>
                    <li>You fill out a survey</li>
                    <li>We match you to your Banter cousin (the Olin family isn’t just for SIBBs anymore!)</li>
                    <li>You decide how you’ll meet !</li>
                  </ul></li>
                </ul>

                <h2>FAQ</h2>
                <p><strong>Q:</strong> Are all alumni eligible to participate?</p>
                <p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes!  As part of the Banter Reboot, we welcome all interested alumni to participate.</p>
                <p><strong>Q:</strong>  I’m an international alum.  Can I participate?</p>
                <p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes!  We would love to have everyone participate in the program.</p>
                <p><strong>Q:</strong>  I’m an alum.  Can I mentor younger alums and/or students?</p>
                <p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, this is a new step for this program.  Recently graduated alumni (Class of 2015) have the opportunity this year to pair with less recent alumni (Class of 2013 and older).  The minimum 2 year difference allows for greater diversity of experiences.  On the interest survey, you can indicate your preference for student or recent graduate.</p>
                <p><strong>Q:</strong> How are the pairings made?</p>
                <p><strong>A:</strong>  Each participant will take a survey that we will use to automatically prepare a profile that describes who they are and some criteria that we believe should help to create more effective pairings. Students/young alums will read through these profiles and submit their top three alumni choices to us. We, the program coordinators, will then arrange the list of alumnus/student pairings. If more than one student or young alum selects a single alumnus, that alumnus may choose a single match or agree to be paired with more than one person. Hopefully, this process will help to produce mutually agreeable pairs for long lasting conversations.</p>
                <p><strong>Q:</strong> How long will we be paired for? </p>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> You’ll be officially paired for one calendar year, but we hope you’ll keep in touch after the year commitment ends!</p>
                <p><strong>Q:</strong> How much time should I set aside for this program? </p>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> This may vary, depending on how much time alumni and students have. At a minimum, expect to set aside one to two hours per month.  Please work together on this!  It takes two to have a dialogue.</p>
                <p><strong>Q:</strong> What if I can’t make a monthly meeting?</p>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> Once the initial pairings have been set up, it will be up to the student and alumnus to establish a monthly time and communication format that will work for them. We will provide encouragement and monthly topics that can be used as conversation starters.</p>
                <p><strong>Q:</strong> Do we both need to be in the same part of the world?</p>
                <p><strong>A:</strong>  No! You both can be anywhere in the world, as long as you have an internet connection!</p>
                <p><strong>Q:</strong> Do I need to have a web camera?</p>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> Once you’ve been paired, it’s up to you and your mentor/mentee to figure out what communication method will be best going forwards. Most of the pairs keep in touch by Skype or Google Hangout amongst other communication methods.  One pair last year mailed letters to each other.  Others just use email.  As long as the conversation continues, the sky’s the limit!</p>
                <p><strong>Q:</strong> I’m a current student. Do I have to know what I want to do after Olin?</p>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> Nope, but you should indicate on your slide that you don’t know your post-grad plans. How many people even know what they want to do next week? We don’t require you to know the future, but any questions you may have regarding life after Olin will certainly serve to enrich the conversation!</p>
                <p><strong>Q:</strong> As an alum, am I guaranteed to have a current student or young alum to mentor?</p>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> Not every alumnus who participates may be matched. And that’s not a bad thing! We need alums in our mentor pool in case a pairing that we make doesn’t work out and the student/young alum would like a new mentor. Also, by submitting a profile to be a mentor, we’ll hang onto it for any future pairings!</p>
                <p><strong>Q:</strong> What will the tone of the conversation be like? </p>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> Each pair will set the tone for their meetings, but you should be thinking “coffee with a friend” rather than “business interview.” </p>
                <p><strong>Q:</strong> Can my alumnus help me finish my problem set or be my tutor?</p>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> They can (they’re quite smart!), but this isn’t really the forum for it. If over the course of a mentorship the conversation naturally leads to a discussion of a topic relevant to a student’s coursework, that’s fine. However, you shouldn’t expect the alumnus to want to help you solve a Fourier transform.</p>
                <p><strong>Q:</strong> Are alumni old and boring?</p>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> Not at all! It might seem like alumni are becoming more boring - we drink a little less and go to sleep a little earlier than we used to - but we have some great insight into the industries you may be interested in and what life after college looks like for Olin grads. We’re not old, but maybe we are a little stiff. </p>
                <p><strong>Q:</strong> Is this a dating service?  </p>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> No! We’re not a Match.com or OkCupid. We are trying to do something that connects alumni to students in a professional capacity only. Along the way, we hope that this program results in a few lifelong friendships.</p>
